  <h2>About</h2>
  <p><i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> is a generational favorite in my family. They showed me this movie when I was younger, and it’s been my favorite ever since. The plot, acting, and character development are all excellent. The theme of revenge and redemption keeps you hooked from start to finish.</p>
